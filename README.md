# Codejam
Solutions from past [Google Codejam][1] contests to practice.

# Just to clarify 
The solutions that I add here with the prefix "*OG_*" are the ones I did during the contests.
They may not be _optimal_, so don't expect that. What you surely can expect is that they solve something 
if they're here. 
 * If the problem has a number suffix, is because that code passed the test with that number (TS_n means Test Set n). 
 * If the problem passed all tests, it won't have a suffix and it will be explained line by line in order
 to be useful in case someone reads it.
My contest user is MonsieurGalois. In the codejam database from some years you will see my solutions there but
they won't be explained.

I do this because I don't see many of the solutions of this problems explained, and I never find solutions that 
can help new contestants to learn how are solved the problems.
